      "body": "ICE is a rather complex protocol, but the underlying ideas are simple:\r\n\r\n- Assume an established channel over which the peer can coordinate\r\n- Endpoints are behind NAT. If they send a packet towards a destination IP and port, they often cannot predict the exact source IP and port.\r\n       - But with the help of STUN servers and possibly UPNP or NAT-PMP, try to predict the IP+port at which they can be reachable through the local set of NATs\r\n       - Of course this is guesswork.\r\n- Each endpoint communicates the set of plausible IP + port numbers pairs to the peer over the signalling channel\r\n- Each of the endpoints send a set of probes to these guessed port numbers\r\n     - Many of these probes will not make it, because of firewall rules such as only accepting incoming traffic on an IP and port if there was some outgoing traffic in the same direction, \r\n     - but the hope is that there will be that out of the set of packets sent by each endpoint, there will be at least one in which the guessing worked.\r\n- If one of the probe made it through, confirm that to the peer. There is now a workable peer-to-peer path.\r\n- In no probe arrives, then fall back to a proxy of some kind, for example using TURN.\r\n\r\nThere are additional complexities:\r\n\r\n- sending probes has side effects. For example, sending too many probes forces the local NAT to create as many mapping context, and some of these NAT only support a small set of simultaneous mapping. Thus, the strategy of sending 256 packets from each side and relying on the birthday paradox may not be the best.\r\n\r\n- sending list of IP addresses has privacy issues, especially when disclosing addresses behind the NAT, so consider using some substitute, e.g, a randomized Bonjour name.\r\n\r\n- tricking a peer to send a bunch of messages to random addresses can obviously be used in DOS attacks\r\n\r\nWhich means we do not have just one message, but rather 3 or 5:\r\n\r\n- An address message, \"here is my list of addresses\", sent over the signalling channel, which in our case could be a proxied QUIC connection. \r\n- A probe message, sent to one of the candidate peer address+port, which could be very similar to a PATH_CHALLENGE\r\n- A probe response, which could be very similar to a PATH_RESPONSE\r\n- Maybe an address response, as in \"I see your packet as coming from IP=A, Port=P\", by which the endpoint could learn how its own address is seen by the peer.\r\n- Maybe some synchronization message, as in \"try me now\", because the port opening only works well if both endpoints send their packets within a short interval.\r\n\r\nWe can debate whether the probing should use existing frames (e.g. PATH_CHALLENGE) or a new ICE frame,  but we would have to explain that these ICE frames are sent on the probed paths, just like path challenge.\r\n\r\nSince this is a rather complex issue, it might be simpler to start with the scenario in which there is an existing proxied connection between the two endpoints, and we are merely trying to migrate the traffic to a direct path.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I agree that ICE is quite complex, and I've spent a fair amount of time reading the RFCs, and I'm not sure I've fully understood it...\r\nHowever, I also don't want to reinvent the wheel. It seems like ICE already solves all the points you list in the first two lists of your post. Where do you see the simplification coming from when dropping ICE for our own home-grown protocol?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>  It might make sense to start from Multipath QUIC, with one path through the proxy and another for the peer-to-peer shortcut.\r\n\r\nThis definitely should work well with Multipath QUIC (that actually should be a design goal of this protocol), but I'd prefer to not make it a requirement, if we can avoid it. RFC 9000 allows keeping several paths alive, and endpoints could keep the proxied connection alive (by regularly sending probing packets) after they've migrated to a direct path. On the other hand, this is probably not what the proxy wants: It wants to free up resources as quickly as possible. How does ICE handle this?\r\n\r\n> NAT rebinding can happen at either end, and will break the \"peer-to-peer\" path. \r\n\r\nDo we have any numbers on how often NAT rebindings actually happen, and if they can be avoided by more aggressive keep-alives? Given the trouble endpoints have gone through to establish a hole-punched connections, it might be justified to invest more into keeping the NAT binding alive (e.g. send a PING frame at least every 5s or so). It would be nice if we could base this kind of recommendation on data though.",

However, I don't think it needs anything multipath-specific, and can run on top of a RFC 9000 stack just as well.\r\n\r\nIn specific:\r\n1. RFC 9000 already allows a client to simultaneously probe an arbitrary number of paths, and to keep them alive (by sending probing packets). The only thing that multipath adds here is the capability to send / receive on multiple paths at the same time, but a NAT won't even be able to distinguish between these scenarios.\r\n1. Multipath doesn't allow the server to initiate a new path: as in RFC 9000, path initiation is solely the client's responsibility. A NAT traversal solution will need to define a way for the server to send a hole punching packet either way.\r\n\r\nRelated: #1.",

This can cause a lot of amplification: one packet from the client, as many packets as there are addresses to be punched from the server.

This is a bit hard, because the packets have to include a CID proposed by the client.\r\n* mitigate request spoofing by using the same heuristics used today on client side, such as implement a list of port numbers that will never be punched, check the scope of addresses, etc.\r\n* mitigate amplification by limiting the number of addresses that a server will punch. Consider that if the client sends a new PUNCH ME NOW frame, the previous one is abandoned.\r\n* mitigate amplification by having at most one PUNCH ME NOW frame in a packet. Or maybe limit PUNCH ME NOW to just one address, and just keep act on the last N (3?) PUNCH ME NOW frame received\r\n* mitigate amplification by requiring that PUNCH ME NOW frames be carried in fully padded packets, like \"initial\" or \"challenge\"\r\n* mitigate amplification by allowing servers to send small size probing packets.\r\n\r\nDiscuss?",
